Chocolate is made using cacao beans which come from the Theobroma cacao tree. This tree is grown by cacao farmers in tropical climates throughout the world.

Flowers can develop throughout the year, and the tree has the unusual trait of having both flowers and fruit on the tree at the same time. The fruit of the tree is known as the cacao pod.

Expertise is needed in deciding when the cacao pods are ripe and ready to harvest. Harvesting is usually done by hand as great care is needed to ensure the bark of the tree is not damaged. If damaged it can limit the number of flowers the tree produces in the future.

Once the pods are harvested they are cut open to remove the beans and pulp from inside. Each pod contains around 30 to 50 cacao beans.
