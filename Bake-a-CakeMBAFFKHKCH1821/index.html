               Gather your ingredients. To make a vanilla pound cake from scratch, you’ll need wet and dry ingredients. The wet ingredients include softened unsalted butter, 5 eggs, 1 cup (200 g) of sugar, and vanilla extract. The dry ingredients include ½ tsp (3 g) of salt and 2 cups (400 g) of cake flour.
Cake flour has a lower protein content that gives cakes a tender texture and fine crumb.[1]
Believe it or not, sugar is a wet ingredient because it’s always creamed with butter (a wet ingredient).
If you don’t have cake flour, use 2 cups (400 g) of all-purpose flour and 2 tbsp (28 g) of cornstarch.
                
Preheat the oven to 325 °F (163 °C) and grease and flour a cake pan. Traditionally, pound cakes bake in loaf or bundt pans because of their dense texture. After preheating your oven, use butter or shortening to grease the inside of your pan. Then, sprinkle a light layer of flour over the grease, rotating the pan until it’s evenly coated. Tap out the excess over a trash can.[2]
Greasing and flouring the pan makes it easier to remove your cake later.
