It is no coincidence that successful people have certain qualities in common that set them apart from the crowd. What makes successful people successful? Do they possess some innate traits or do they simply approach everyday challenges in a different way?

Tons of material has been written on the winning formula for success, but success entails a lot more than knowing how to succeed. Whatâ€™s good to know, though, is that it has to do less with the capabilities people are born with, and more with the attitude they have towards life.
